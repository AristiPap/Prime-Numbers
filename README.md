# Prime-Numbers
The following programs are two different implementations that calculate how many prime numbers exist between two random numbers that the user enters as input.One of the implementations is based on the Miller-Rabin algorithm and the other uses specific tricks to minimize the process time.Note that each implementation can take input for numbers upto 4090000000
